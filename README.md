# 7 Days Toss Up Project in C++
Purpose is to create a (very) simple simulation which re-enacts the Battle of Seven Days using coin flips.



# PseudoCode
1) Declare variables
2) Print the beginning title and instructions
3) use for loop along with switch to print the battle title
4) take the valid guess from the user
5) use rand() to generate the random toss from the computer
6) use if-else statements to generate the coin flip and use increment operator for game score
7) print final score and winner name using if else and '=' operator
8) See-out the end title
